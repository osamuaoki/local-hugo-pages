# Skeleton codes to build simple wiki pages on localhost

These skelton codes are for locally hosted and served private wiki pages.

This code publicly hosted on as
[local-hugo-pages](https://github.com/osamuaoki/local-hugo-pages)
is only skelton codes without real contents.

The content of this site will be written in the markdown.  The corresponding
HTML files are generated by using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

In order to keep my memos private, I use this after:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/Documents
$ cd ~/Documents
$ git clone https://github.com/osamuaoki/local-hugo-pages.git ~/Documents/notes/
$ git checkout -b local
```

This is based on theme [yihui/hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin).
